## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control a snake and navigate it across the screen, collecting food items to grow while avoiding obstacles. There are two types of food items: pizzas, which increase the snake's length, and rotten bones, which decrease the snake's length. Be strategic in your choices!

## Powerups

In addition to food items, there are three powerups available in the game:

1. **Potion**: This powerup increases the snake's movespeed, allowing it to move faster and navigate through the level more efficiently.

2. **Magic Essence**: The magic essence powerup grants the snake the ability to phase through objects temporarily. Use this powerup strategically to avoid obstacles and navigate through tight spaces.

3. **Diamond**: Collecting the diamond powerup doubles the score earned from picking up food items. Grab this powerup to maximize your score and climb up the leaderboard!

## Level Generation

The game features dynamically generated levels using a simple generation algorithm. Each playthrough offers a unique level layout (either vertical or horizontal obstacles), providing variety and challenge to keep players engaged.

## Game Music

The captivating game music is created using Bfxr and Bosca Ceoil, ensuring an immersive and enjoyable audio experience while playing the game.
